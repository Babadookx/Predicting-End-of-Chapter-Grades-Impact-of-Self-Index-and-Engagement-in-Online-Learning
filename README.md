## üìò Overview
This project investigates predictors of student performance in an online statistics and data science platform, **CourseKata**, using **End-of-Chapter (EOC)** correction rates as the primary outcome.  
Data include **engagement metrics** (on-page time, idle time, off-page time) and **self-reported motivational indices** (Intrinsic Value, Utility Value, Cost, Expectancy).  

The analysis focuses on understanding:  
- How self-assessment accuracy relates to performance,  
- How idle time and engagement trends shift across chapters, and  
- Performance differences between students who **completed** all chapters vs. those who did not.

The repository contains:
- `aaFinalCode.Rmd`: Full R Markdown with data wrangling, exploratory graphs, and modeling.  
- `aaFinalCode.html`: Rendered HTML version of the full analysis.  
- `final_poster_Nightingale.pdf`: Concise project poster with finalized results.  
- `checkpoints_eoc.csv`, `checkpoints_pulse.csv`, `page_views.csv`: Core datasets (large file may be omitted).

## üîç Key Findings
- **Self-Index strongly predicts grades:** Students who rated their understanding higher performed better overall (Œ≤ ‚âà 0.007, *p* < 0.0001).  
- **Idle time slightly reduces performance:** A small but significant negative effect (*p* ‚âà 0.018).  
- **Later chapters are harder:** Scores decline in chapters 9‚Äì13 compared to chapters 1‚Äì4 (*p* < 0.0001).  
- **Completion matters:** Students completing all chapters consistently scored higher than those who did not (*t*-test *p* ‚âà 0.08).  
- Findings support the **Practicing Connections Hypothesis**: deliberate practice across complex problems promotes deeper understanding:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## üß™ Methods
- **Descriptive statistics**: ANOVA (normal var
- iables) and Kruskal‚ÄìWallis (skewed variables) for chapter group comparisons.
- **Modeling**:  
  Linear Mixed Model (LMM):  
  \[
  EOC ~ \text{Total_Level} + \text{idle\_brief} + \text{chapter\_group} + (1|\text{student\_id}) + (1|\text{chapter\_number})
  \]
  with random intercepts for students and chapters.
- **Exploration**: Additional plots (caterpillar plots, alternate binning, etc.) were generated to guide modeling but are not all included in the final poster.
